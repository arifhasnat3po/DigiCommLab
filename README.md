# DigiCommLab

DigiCommLab
DigiCommLab is a repository containing various examples and projects related to digital communication techniques implemented using MATLAB. The repository provides resources for students, researchers, and professionals to learn, experiment, and apply digital communication techniques in their projects and research.

Table of Contents
The repository is organized into the following sections:

Modulation: Examples of how to implement and simulate various modulation techniques such as amplitude modulation (AM), frequency modulation (FM), and phase modulation (PM).

Demodulation: Examples of how to demodulate different types of modulated signals, including coherent and non-coherent demodulation.

Channel Coding: Examples of how to encode and decode data for error detection and correction, including convolutional codes and block codes.

Equalization: Examples of how to equalize distorted signals caused by channel impairments, such as multipath fading and inter-symbol interference.

Synchronization: Examples of how to synchronize the receiver with the transmitter, including symbol timing and carrier frequency synchronization.

Simulation: Examples of how to simulate digital communication systems using MATLAB, including building end-to-end communication systems, signal visualization, and performance evaluation.
